Abstract
--------
We make a number of comments regarding modelling degeneracies in strong lensing measurements ofthe Hubble parameter H0.  The first point concerns the use of stellar kinematics to resolve the mass sheet degeneracy:  we show that external convergence terms associated with the lens-source and observer-lens lines of sight need to be included in cosmographic modelling, in addition to the usual observer-source term, to avoid systematic bias in the inferred value of H0.  The second point concerns the use of imaging data for multiple strongly-lensed sources in a given system.  We show that the mass sheet degeneracy is not fully resolved by the availability of multiple sources: some degeneracy remains because of differential external convergence between the different sources. Similarly, differential external convergence also complicates the use of multiple sources in addressing the approximate mass sheet degeneracy associated with a local (“internal”) core component in lens galaxies.  This internal-external degeneracy is amplified by the non-monotonicity of the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift. For a rough assessment of the weak lensing effects, we provide estimates of external convergence using the nonlinear matter power spectrum, paying attention to non-equal time correlators.

Notebooks
---------
For understanding on how we obtained our results,
we prepared a dedicated jupyter notebook:
